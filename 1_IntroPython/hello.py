Let's build on what we learned so far.
We'll work with functions, strings, itegers, booleans, etc.
to write code to do fun things and incrementally write code

Note: you may need to remove the first 2 lines of code for this to work
on your machine.

# Main call of function
hello()

# Things to consider implements:
# 1) pass a string to the hello function (like a name) to print after "hello"

# 2) implement a check to see if the string is a proper name and if not,
#    request a new string

# 3) Add a birth year to calculate the user's name and return it

# 4) Store the users name and age in a variable as a tuple and write a new
#    function that then calculates the year that the user will turn 21 or the
#    year that user turned 21, use print to return a sensible message.

# 5) Extend this function
